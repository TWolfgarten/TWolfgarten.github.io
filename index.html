 <p align="justify">I am currently a PhD student at <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/igpp/">IGPP</a>, the Institute for Global Pandemic Planning, at the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk">University of Warwick</a>.
  Originally an economist (<a href="https://portal.uni-koeln.de/en/uoc-home">University of Cologne</a>) and statistician (<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk">University of Warwick</a>), my research focusses on measuring and modelling human behaviour during pandemics, using large scale data sets, like mobile phone location data.
  My research is multi-disciplinary, combining Mathematical Epidemiology and Behavioural Science. 
  Supervisors: <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/zeeman_institute/staffv2/keeling/">Matt Keeling</a> (Math Epi) and <a href="https://www.wbs.ac.uk/about/person/neil-stewart/">Neil Stewart</a> (Beh Sci). 
  Besides IGPP, I am also associated with Warwick's <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/zeeman_institute/">SBIDER group</a> and <a href="https://www.wbs.ac.uk">WBS</a>'s <a href="https://www.wbs.ac.uk/research/subject-groups/bs/">Behavioural Science group</a>.
