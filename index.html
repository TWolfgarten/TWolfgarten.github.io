<p> Thomas Wolfgarten, I am currently a PhD student at <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/igpp/">IGPP</a>, the Institute for Global Pandemic Planning, at the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk">University of Warwick</a>.
  Originally an Economist (<a href="https://portal.uni-koeln.de/en/uoc-home"> University of Cologne</a>) and Statistician (<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk">University of Warwick</a>), my research focusses on measuring and modelling human behaviour during pandemics, using large scale data sets, like mobile phone location data.
  My research is multi-disciplinary, using Mathematical Epidemiology and Behavioural Science. My supervisors are <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/zeeman_institute/staffv2/keeling/">Matt Keeling </a> (Math Epi) and <a href="https://www.wbs.ac.uk/about/person/neil-stewart/"> Neil Stewart </a> (Beh Sci). 
  Besides IGPP I am also associated with Warwick's <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/zeeman_institute/"> SBIDER group </a> and <a href="https://www.wbs.ac.uk"> WBS </a>.

  Once I find some time, you will find my publication PDFs, links to the code, <a href="https://julialang.org"> Julia </a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com"> cloud computing </a> tutorials.
